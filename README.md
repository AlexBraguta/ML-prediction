## Description üìù
This is a humble attempt to get a prediction for BTC/USDT (or any other selected coin)

- It collects candlestick data across 1h, 2h, 4h, 12h and 1d timeframes,
- Computes a variety of technical indicators (`SMA`, `RSI`, `MACD`, `ATR`, `Bollinger Bands`, `EWMA`, etc.),
- Builds classification models (`Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`)
- to forecast whether the price will go **UP** or **DOWN** in the next 4 hours.
- It automatically tunes hyperparameters, evaluates fit (over-/under-fitting),
- and‚Äîif the chosen model is overfitted‚Äîiteratively simplifies it up to three times.

## Features ‚ú®
- Multi-timeframe data merge  
- Extensive feature engineering with `ta` indicators  
- SMOTE balancing for imbalanced classes  
- Randomized hyperparameter search with time-series CV  
- Automated overfitting detection & model simplification  
- Final prediction output with probability and timestamp  

## Requirements üìã
- Python ‚â• 3.8  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `imblearn`, `ta`, `matplotlib`, `joblib`  
- Access to Binance REST API data  

## Installation üöÄ
1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-prediction.git`  
   `cd ML-prediction`  
2. Create & activate a virtual environment  
   `python -m venv venv`  
   `source venv/bin/activate`  
3. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Binance API Key should be set in Environment

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
`python main.py`  

Outputs model summaries and a 4-hour forecast at the end, e.g.:  
```
Prediction: The price is likely to go UP in the next 4 hours.
Prediction Probability: UP 65.34%, DOWN 34.66%
2025-03-10 13:50
```

(if you made it so far, to save you the trouble: best working models are 15 and 17)
